## How to Specify Multiple Languages<a name="multilang-embedded-output-captions"></a>

+ If your input captions format is embedded \(that is, you are passing through embedded\-to\-embedded\), you need to create only one group of captions settings\. The captions selector that you choose under **Captions source** includes all languages from the input\.

+ If your input captions are not embedded, you can include only one captions language per output\. In each output, include one group of captions settings\. Under **Captions source**, choose the selector that is set up for the language that you want to include\.
