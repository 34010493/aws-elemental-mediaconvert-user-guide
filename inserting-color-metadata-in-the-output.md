# Inserting Color Metadata in the Output<a name="inserting-color-metadata-in-the-output"></a>

Insert color metadata into each output stream where you need it and disable insertion where you don't need it\. To do this, in the output's stream settings, toggle the **Insert color metadata** check box\. 

**Note**  
Depending on the output type, you might need to choose the output's **More Settings** option to reveal the insert color metadata check box\.
