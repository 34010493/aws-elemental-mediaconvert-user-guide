# About Specifying the Overlay Start Time<a name="about-specifying-overlay-start-time"></a>

When you specify the start time for your overlay, you provide the timecode for the first frame where you want the overlay to appear\. For the overlay to appear when you expect it, make sure that the timecode works with how you set up your timecode configuration in your job settings and in your input settings\. This topic provides two examples that result in a successfully placed graphic overlay\. For more information about timecode configuration, see [ Setting Up Timecodes  Learn how to set up your timecode\. Check the timecode setup when you troubleshoot features such as input clipping, graphic image overlay \(image inserter\), audio and captions sync, output timecode metadata, and variant playlist timestamps\.    MediaConvert manages transcoded video frames by their timecode\. The service uses the timecode to synchronize some audio and captions, and to determine the timing for displaying video frames in an output\. The service also relies on timecodes to manage features—such as input clipping and graphic overlay \(image inserter\)—that are applied to only some parts of the video\.   If your graphic overlays or sidecar captions aren't appearing when you expect, or aren't appearing at all, try setting both your job\-wide and input timecode **Source** to **Start at 0**\.   There are three distinct groups of timecode settings, located in three different places on the console:  

Job\-wide timecode configuration  
The **Timecode configuration** settings under **Job settings** affect how timecodes appear in the outputs\. The settings also affect the system behavior for features that apply to every output in the job\. This includes the following:  
+ When overlaid graphics \(inserted images\) appear in the video
+ How your HLS variant playlists show time
+ How inserted timecodes appear in your output
+ How the service interprets the timecode that you provide if you specify an anchor timecode
If you use the API or an SDK, you can find these settings in the JSON file of your job\. These settings are under `Settings`, `TimecodeConfig`\. 

Input timecode setting  
The **Timecode source** setting under **Input** affects only the following:  
+ Synchronization for audio and captions that you provide as input files that are separate from the video
+ How the service interprets the timecodes that you provide if you use [input clipping](input-clipping-stitching.md) to specify only a portion of your input for transcoding
If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job, called `TimecodeSource`, located in `Settings`, `Inputs`\. 

Output timecode settings  
The timecode settings under **Output** determine whether and how timecode information appears in each output:  
+ The **Timecode insertion** setting under **Output**, **Stream settings**, **Video** determines whether the service embeds timecode metadata in a given output\. You can insert timecodes into MPEG\-2, Apple ProRes, H\.264, and H\.265 outputs\.
+ The **Timecode burn\-in** settings under **Output**, **Stream settings**, **Video**, **Preprocessors** determine whether the service inscribes the timecode visually on the video frame\.  To provide frame accuracy, AWS Elemental MediaConvert uses timecodes that specify frames by frame number, not by millisecond\. All timecodes are in the following 24\-hour format with a frame number: HH:MM:SS:FF\.   Adjusting the Job\-wide Timecode Configuration  You can set up your timecode configuration under job settings\. These settings affect graphic overlay duration, how time is displayed in HLS variant playlists, and how inserted timecodes appear in the output metadata\. They don't affect input clipping or caption and audio synchronization\. To adjust the job\-wide timecode configuration  On the **Create job** page, in the **Job** pane on the left, choose **Settings**\.    In the **Timecode configuration** section, for **Source**, choose one of the following values:   **Embedded**: The service uses any timecodes that are embedded in the video\.   **Start at 0**: The service ignores any embedded timecodes and assigns the first video frame the timecode 00:00:00:00 \(HH:MM:SS:FF\)\.   **Specified start**: The service ignores any embedded timecodes and assigns the first video frame the value that you provide for **Start Timecode**\.  The **Start Timecode** field appears when you choose **Specified start**\.   If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job, called `Source`, located inside `Settings`, `TimecodeConfig`\. If you don't choose a value for **Source**, the service defaults to **Embedded**\.   If you don's specify **Source** or choose **Embedded** and your input video doesn't have embedded timecodes, your output won't have timecodes\. This means that features that require a timecode\-based start time, such as sidecar captions and graphic overlays, won't appear in your output\.     Set a value for **Anchor Timecode**\. If you use an editing platform that relies on an anchor timecode, use **Anchor timecode** to specify a point at which the input and output frames have the same timecode\. Use the following 24\-hour format with a frame number: HH:MM:SS:FF\. This setting ignores framerate conversion\. The system behavior for **Anchor timecode** varies depending on your setting for **Source**:   If you choose **Start at 0** for **Source**, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in **Anchor timecode**, counting from 00:00:00:00\.  For example, if you set **Anchor timecode** to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is one hour and five seconds into the video\.   If you choose **Embedded** for **Source**, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in **Anchor timecode**, counting from the first embedded timecode\.  For example, if your embedded timecodes start at 01:00:00:00 and you set **Anchor timecode** to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is five seconds into the video\.   If you choose **Specified start** for **Source**, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in **Anchor timecode**, counting from the timecode that you specify for the first frame\. For example, if you specify 00:30:00:00 as your start timecode and you set **Anchor timecode** to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is thirty minutes and five seconds into the video\.   If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job, called `Anchor`, located in `Settings`, `TimecodeConfig`\. If you don't set a value for **Anchor timecode**, the service doesn't use any anchor timecode\.   Under **Timestamp offset**, provide a date\. This setting applies only to outputs that support a program\-date\-time stamp\. Use **Timestamp offset** to overwrite the timecode date without affecting the time and frame number\. This setting has no effect unless you also include the program\-date\-time stamp in the output\. If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job, called `TimestampOffset`, located in `Settings`, `TimecodeConfig`\.      Adjusting the Input Timecode Setting  The value for **Timecode source** that you specify in the input settings affects how the service synchronizes audio and captions that you provide in a file that is separate from the video\. It also affects how the service interprets the timecodes that you provide for input clipping\. For information about input clipping, see [Transcoding Only a Portion of Your Input \(Input Clipping\)](input-clipping-stitching.md)\. To adjust the **Timecode source** setting  On the **Create job** page, in the **Job** pane on the left, choose an input\.   Under **Video selector**, **Timecode source**, specify whether MediaConvert reads timecodes from the input or generates them starting from zero\. Options are as follows:   **Embedded**: The service uses any timecodes embedded in the input video\.    Don't choose this value unless your input video has embedded timecodes\.   ONLY TRUE FOR SERVER       **Start at 0**: The service sets the timecode of the first frame of the job to 00:00:00:00\.     **Specified start**: Do not use this option\.   Regardless of the source, timecodes are in the following 24\-hour format with a frame number: HH:MM:SS:FF\. If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job, called `TimecodeSource`, located in `Settings`, `Inputs`\.     Adjusting the Output Timecode Settings  There are two timecode\-related settings that you can adjust differently for each output\. These are **Timecode insertion** and **Timecode burn\-in**\.  Inserting Timecode Metadata  The **Timecode insertion** setting determines whether a given output has timecodes embedded in its metadata\. MediaConvert automatically puts this information in the appropriate place, depending on the output codec\. For MPEG\-2 and QuickTime codecs, such as Apple ProRes, the service inserts the timecodes in the video I\-frame metadata\. For H\.265 \(HEVC\) and H\.264 \(AVC\), the service inserts the timecodes in the supplemental enhancement information \(SEI\) picture timing message\.  To include timecode metadata in an output  On the **Create job** page, in the **Job** pane on the left, choose an output\.   Under **Stream settings**, **Timecode insertion**, choose **PIC\_TIMING\_SEI** to include timecode metadata\. Choose **Disabled** to leave out timecode metadata\.   If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job, called `TimecodeInsertion`, located in `Settings`, `OutputGroups`, `Outputs`, `VideoDescription`\.   Burning In Timecodes on the Video Frames  The **Timecode burn\-in** setting determines whether a given output has visible timecodes inscribed into the video frames themselves\. The timecodes are not an overlay, but rather a permanent part of the video frames\. To burn in timecodes in an output  On the **Create job** page, in the **Job** pane on the left, choose an output\.   Under **Stream settings**, **Preprocessors**, choose **Timecode burn\-in**\.   Optionally, provide values for the **Prefix**, **Font size**, and **Position** settings\. Even if you don't provide these values, timecodes are burned into your output using these default values:    **Prefix**: no prefix   **Font size**: **Extra Small \(10\)**   **Position**: **Top Center**   For details about each of these settings, choose the **Info** link next to **Timecode burn\-in**\.   If you use the API or an SDK, you can find these settings in the JSON file of your job\. These settings are under `Settings`, `OutputGroups`, `Outputs`, `VideoDescription`, `VideoPreprocessors`, `TimecodeBurnin`\.   ](setting-up-timecode.md)\.

### Timecode Configuration Example: Start at Zero<a name="timecode-configuration-example-start-at-zero"></a>

When you set your timecode source to **Start at 0**, in both the job settings and the input settings, the service ignores timecodes that are embedded in your input and numbers each frame starting from 00:00:00:00\. The service uses the following 24\-hour format with a frame number: HH:MM:SS:FF\. 

In our example, embedded timecodes start at 00:04:30:00\. Suppose that you want a graphic overlay to appear starting two seconds into the video\. You set both your job settings timecode configuration source and your input timecode source to **Start at 0**, and you specify your image overlay **Start time** as 00:00:02:00\. The following diagram illustrates this example\. The table that follows the diagram shows the value of each setting and where to find it on the console and in your JSON job specification\.

**Note**  
In this example, any captions or audio that you provide in a separate file \(that is, any sidecar captions or audio\) also must start at 00:00:00:00\. If you have sidecar files with timecodes that match those embedded with your video, see [Timecode Configuration Example: Embedded Timecodes](#timecode-configuration-example-embedded)\.

![\[The timecodes embedded in the input file appear on a numberline, starting at 00:04:30:00 and ending at 00:04:45:00. Another numberline representing the timecodes for placing the graphic overlay shows the same intervals, with labels starting at 00:00:00:00 and ending at 00:00:15:00. Both numberlines represent 15 seconds of video frames. On both numberlines, a graphic overlay is represented as a rectangle above each line, two seconds into the video and lasting two seconds. In the Embedded timecode numberline, the overlay starts at 00:04:32:00 and ends at 00:04:34:00. On the numberline that shows timecodes for placing the graphic overlay, the overlay starts at 00:00:02:00 and ends at 00:00:04:00.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/images/image-inserter-timecodes-start0.png)

### Timecode Configuration Example: Embedded Timecodes<a name="timecode-configuration-example-embedded"></a>

When you set your timecode source to **Embedded**, in both the job settings and the input settings, the service uses the timecodes that are embedded in your input to synchronize overlaid graphics and any captions or audio that you provide in a separate file \(that is, any sidecar captions or audio\)\.

In our example, embedded timecodes start at 00:04:30:00\. Suppose that you want a graphic overlay to appear starting two seconds into the video\. You set both your job settings timecode configuration source and your input timecode source to **Embedded**, and you specify your image overlay **Start time** as 00:04:32:00\. The following diagram illustrates this example\. The table that follows the diagram shows the value of each setting and where to find it on the console and in your JSON job specification\.

**Note**  
In this example, your input must have embedded timecodes\. Also, any captions or audio that you provide in a separate file \(that is, any sidecar captions or audio\) must start at the same timecode as your video\. If you have sidecar files with timecodes that start with zero, see [Timecode Configuration Example: Start at Zero](#timecode-configuration-example-start-at-zero)\.

![\[The timecodes that are embedded in the input file appear on a numberline, starting at 00:04:30:00 and ending at 00:04:45:00. Another numberline that represents the timecodes for placing the graphic overlay shows the same intervals, with the same timecodes. Although these numberlines are different when you set your timecode sources to Start at 0, they are the same in this example. On both numberlines, a graphic overlay is represented as a rectangle above each line, two seconds into the video and lasting two seconds. The overlay starts at 00:04:32:00 and ends at 00:04:34:00.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/images/image-inserter-timecodes-embedded.png)
