|  1030  |  Unsupported Codec  |  The service doesn't support the codec or container of the input file\. See [Supported Input Codecs and Containers](reference-codecs-containers-input.md)\.  | 
|  1040  |  Settings Error  |  One or more of the job's encoding settings aren't supported in the combination specified\. Or, the encoding settings aren't compatible with the input\.   | 
|  1050  |  Disk Full  |  Write error, disk full\. Try reducing the number of outputs in the job, or reducing the length of the output\.  |
