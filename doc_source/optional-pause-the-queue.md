# Optional: Pause Your Queues<a name="optional-pause-the-queue"></a>

After you submit a job and the service begins processing it, you can't cancel it\. If you are just getting started with AWS Elemental MediaConvert or are experimenting with the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console, you might want to pause your queues to avoid accidentally starting a job before you're ready\. For more information about queues, see [Working with Queues](working-with-queues.md)\.

**To pause or reactivate a queue**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/mediaconvert](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert)\.

1. If you are pausing or reactivating a queue other than the default queue, on the navigation bar of the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console, choose the region where the queue was created\.

   A default queue is available in all regions\. Other queues appear only in the region where they are created\.
