# Creating a Queue in MediaConvert<a name="creating-queues"></a>

MediaConvert provides a default queue, but you can choose to create your own queues to manage the resources that are available to your account\. For information about how queues affect the way that MediaConvert allocates the processing of resources, see [How Jobs Are Prioritized](about-resource-allocation-and-job-prioritization.md)\.
