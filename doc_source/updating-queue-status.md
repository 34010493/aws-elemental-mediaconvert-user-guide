# Pausing and Reactivating Queues in MediaConvert<a name="updating-queue-status"></a>

If you want to cancel a job, we recommend that you first pause the corresponding queue so that MediaConvert doesn't start processing the job\. After the status of a job changes from **Submitted** to **Progressing**, you can't cancel it\.

The following procedure explains how to pause and reactivate a queue using the console\.

**To pause or reactivate a queue**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the MediaConvert console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/mediaconvert](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert)\.

1. If you are pausing or reactivating a queue other than the default queue, on the navigation bar of the MediaConvert console, choose the region where the queue was created\.
