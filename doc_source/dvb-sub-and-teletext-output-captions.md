+ If your input captions are in a different format, create one group of captions settings for each language\. Put each group of captions settings in the same output\. They will appear in the list of settings groups as Captions 1, Captions 2, and so forth\. In each group of settings, choose the captions selector under **Captions source** that is set up for the language that you want to include\.
